Hi There!

I'm Anthony Calabrese, and welcome to my github profile! I'm an aspiring software engineer currently studying at the university of central florida, working towards my bacehlors in computer science.

I love coding and seeing my ideas come to life, and I'm always ready to put my skills to the test.

Past coding, I love video games and reading, as well as tabletop rpgs.
